This commit message falsely states that the default '/tmp' path can be
modified at compile time.  This is not true anymore.  This patch restricts
fallback on non-Windows to '/tmp' and the start-up directory for OpenVPN
on Windows.  On all POSIX platforms '/tmp' should exist anyway and it can
be modified by setting $TMPDIR at runtime, or via --tmp-dir.

This patch also includes a two comments to the #ifdef blocks in the same
area.  These lines were not removed as they were considered helpful and it
does not change the running code in any way.  It was initially added to
make sure the changes needed in this patch came on the right place.  It
should probably have been mentioned in the commit log anyhow though.
